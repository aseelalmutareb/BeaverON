    <div id='header-about-two' class="middle-box flex flex-col mt-10">
        Why Beaver ON? More than any other factor, it's the most instrumental in motivating French exploration in the New World and for the establishment of Dutch and English trading posts that opened New York to colonization: the BEAVER. 
            Known as "nature's builder", as well as, Beaver ON, as  the complete package of focused, smart-and-hard working, brilliant, and creative brains and builders in New York.
            Treating New York City as an open-air museum, Beaver On captures the brilliant glow of  the neon signs, those iconic elements of the cityscape, the powerful impact of it as this never-sleeping city continues to live. That's how Beaver ON describes their prowess: captivating and lustful. Their minds create the life of the digital world.
            Beavers symbolize the rising New York State; they transform the impossible to success. Beaver GO is New York, building to serve around the globe.</div>

          Building business value through the hopes-for-humans currency.
          Molding a realization that the real value is in real connections, where the customers always have the final say in what's genuine in the full potential of the internet — universal access to research and education, full participation in culture — to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.
          Beaver ON is on a mission to do away with the tomfoolery getting pervasive in today’s digital agencies. To focus on doing what’s right and true for our customers (which just so happens to be what’s right and true for their business too).
          Building stable bridges is a rich affirmation to show that we really get them. We develop and flourish websites and we build campaigns that forge a connection through a range of compelling visual language, artful messaging, and charm. It's not black and white; but Beaver ON isn't grey too. Our culture and collective mindset are the precious kinds that embrace authenticity. 
          We're golden. Humans always come first.
